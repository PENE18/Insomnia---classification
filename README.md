## Overview
- This is a simple classification . The trained model Catboost classifier takes an induvidie as an input and predict the class of the pacient.
## Motivation 
- Like most of you, I spend my time cooking, watching Netflix, coding and reading the latest research papers at the weekends. The idea of classifying indivuduals struck me when I   was browsing research papers. I could not find any relevant research paper (and of course dataset!) associated with this topic. This led me to collect data in Kaggle to train a   learning model.
## Technical Aspect 
    This project is divided into two part:
    1. Explotary Data Analysis
    2. Building a machine learning model (Catboost):
        * Training Pipeline
        * Testing the model
